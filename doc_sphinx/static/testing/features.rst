.. _onetick py test features:


Plugin features
===============

Fixtures
--------

`pytest` introduces fixtures to simplify testing and share common resources between tests.
More about fixtures is in `official pytest documentation
<https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html#fixtures-api>`_ as well as
see the `list <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/fixtures.html#fixture>`_ of fixtures
provided by pytest package itself.


Location fixtures
`````````````````

Fixtures that helps to get directories

======================  ==============================================================
Name                    Description
======================  ==============================================================
``cur_dir``             gets the absolute path to the folder with the test.
----------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------
``par_dir``             gets the absolute path to the parent folder of the test.
----------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------
``keep_generated_dir``  returns the absolute path to the folder were the test will be
                        saved if the ``keep-generated`` flag is specified.
======================  ==============================================================


Session fixtures
````````````````

Session fixtures provide an instance of :class:`otp.Session <onetick.py.Session>`
to a test and take care of gracefully destroying after.


================  ==============================================================
Name              Description
================  ==============================================================
``f_session``     The ``function`` scope session. A session instance is created
                  before a test and destroyed after.

                  Example:

                  ::

                    def test_1(f_session):
                        # `f_session` points to a new instance of the otp.Session
                        ...

                    def test_2(f_session):
                        # here `f_session` is a new instance
                        ...

----------------  --------------------------------------------------------------
``c_session``     The ``class`` scope session.

                  Example:

                  ::

                    class TestSomething:

                        def test_1(self, c_session):
                            # `c_session` is created for this class on the first occurance
                            ...

                        def test_2(self, c_session):
                            # the `c_session` instance is the same as in test `test_1`


                    class TestSomethingElse:

                        def test_1(self, c_session):
                            # here the `c_session` is a new instance because it is a test
                            # of another test class
                            ...

                  The ``f_session`` fixture in classes creates a new instance for every
                  test.

----------------  --------------------------------------------------------------
``m_session``     The ``module`` scope session; it is created on the first
                  usage and destroyed only when all tests in the test file are executed.
----------------  --------------------------------------------------------------
``otq_path``      Allows to specify `OTQ_PATH` in :class:`ontick config <onetick.py.Config>`
                  with the location of OTQ files.
                  By default `OTQ_PATH` is not specified for session fixtures.

                  You need to override this fixture to specify your own value.

                  ::

                    import pytest


                    @pytest.fixture
                    def otq_path(cur_dir):
                        return cur_dir / 'otqs'


                    def test_1(f_session):
                        # an instance of that `f_session` will search for otqs in
                        # specified path
                        ...

                    def test_2(f_session):
                        # the same with this instance of the `f_session`
                        ...

                  .. note::
                     The ``otq_path`` fixture will be automatically applied for all
                     tests with the same scope. Scope visibility could be adjusted
                     using modules and classes.
                     For example

                     ::

                        class TestCustomOTQS:

                            @pytest.fixture
                            def otq_path(self, cur_dir):
                                # this fixture will be used by any session fixtrue
                                # in this class
                                ...


                        def test_1(f_session):
                            # ... but makes not effect on this session

======================  =======================================  =============  ===================
``default_tz``          Allows to override the default           str            EST5EDT
                        timezone.
----------------------  ---------------------------------------  -------------  -------------------
``default_start_time``  Start time for any query interval        str            2003/12/01 00:00:00
                        of the :func:`otp.run <onetick.py.run>`
----------------------  ---------------------------------------  -------------  -------------------
``default_end_time``    End time for any query interval          str            2003/12/04 00:00:00
                        of the :func:`otp.run <onetick.py.run>`
----------------------  ---------------------------------------  -------------  -------------------
``default_symbol``      Default symbol name that is used         str            AAPL
                        everywhere where OneTick requires it,
                        for example any tick source like
                        the
                        :class:`otp.Source <onetick.py.Source>`
----------------------  ---------------------------------------  -------------  -------------------
``default_database``    Default database that is used            str            DEMO_L1
                        everywhere where OneTick expects it
======================  =======================================  =============  ===================

These fixtures are automatically picked up by the provided session fixtures such as `f_session`.
You just need to override a fixture with your value and it will be automatically picked up for all
fixtures with the same scope.

For example

::


    @pytest.fixture
    def default_tz():
       return 'GMT'

    def test_something(f_session):
        # f_session picks up the `default_tz` value on initialization
        ...


.. note::

   Default values come from the default OneTick installation that distributes a sample of trades
   in the DEMO_L1 database. Using this default values helps share issues
   with the OneTick support team.


The ``--keep-generated`` flag
`````````````````````````````

.. _keep generated flag:

The plugin adds a custom ``--keep-generated`` flag to `pytest` that allows to control
the lifetime of generated resources during tests: config files for ``otp.Session``, databases, OTQ queries, etc.

It's helpful in case something goes wrong and a developer wants to take a closer look
into the resources generated during testing.

Description from the ``pytest -h``

::

    custom options:
      --keep-generated=KEEP_GENERATED

        Policy to keep temporary generated files, that has several options to run:
        * 'never' - do not keep any temporary generated files during the test run (default)
        * 'fail' - keep temporary generated files only when a test fails
        * 'always' - keep temporary generated files for every test
        Example: pytest --keep-generated=fail


This flag handles only folders and files that are created using the :class:`otp.TmpFile <onetick.py.utils.temp.TmpFile>`
and :class:`otp.TmpDir <onetick.py.utils.temp.TmpDir>` correspondingly.
We use theses classes to create databases,
log files and any configuration files related to the :class:`otp.Session <onetick.py.Session>`.

Developers could also use these classes in code and tests to handle them in case of testing
and debugging.


Example:

::

    pytest -vs --keep-generated=always


This command will print out the path to a folder with the saved resources

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pytest -vs

This ``[[ Generated resources: /tmp/test_user/run_20231129_101141_23129/test_my/test_simple ]]`` line points us where we could find the resources. Let's go there and list the folder

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd /tmp/test_user/run_20231129_101141_23129/test_my/test_simple
    $ ls

    boisterous-ant.locator  dancing-wombat.cfg  green-buffalo.run.otq
    run.sh  tunneling-hippo.acl

* ``dancing-wombat.cfg`` is a OneTick config file that the test's session creates and uses
* ``tunneling-hippo.acl`` is the ACL that the ``dancing-wombat.cfg`` config points to
* ``boisterous-ant.locator`` is a locator file that the ``dancing-wombat.cfg`` config points to; it consists of databases that have been added into the test's session
* ``green-buffalo.run.otq`` is a query that has been passed into ``otp.run`` during tests; every call of that function dumps a query that can then be viewed as an OTQ
* the ``run.sh`` script allows to spin up a tick server using the saved configs and to play with the saved OTQ queries (On Windows it is the ``run.bat`` script)

The ``--show-stack-trace`` flag
```````````````````````````````

.. _show stack trace flag:

Show stack trace with a line of `onetick.py` code where the issues has happened
in case of failure.

.. note :

   It slows down a test run and could be sensitive if you have a lot of tests.


This flag enables the same mechanism like the :class:`otp.config['show_stack_info'] <onetick.py.configuration.Config>` flag does.

Our plugin adds OneTick version into the pytest output. You might find it in the
header of the output where pytest lists the plugins and their versions.

In the following example

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pytest -vs

    ...

the following line shows OneTick related dependencies

.. code-block:: bash
