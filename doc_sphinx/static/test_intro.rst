Testing and debugging
======================

This chapter is about query testing capabilities that we provide along with a query development API.

It can be used in the query development cycle to:

- check that a query is correct and can be used in production
- make changes to queries without introducing bugs to existing functionality
- provide fully self-contained (with data) reproducible cases for unexpected / wrong query behavior
- illustrate how a query works using simple runnable examples.
