Symbol Parameters Objects
=========================

Note that these objects are internal and can't be created manually.
They can only be returned with other onetick.py functions or methods, e.g. :py:meth:`onetick.py.Source.to_symbol_param`

.. autoclass:: onetick.py.core._source._symbol_param._SymbolParamSource()
   :members: __getitem__, schema

.. autoclass:: onetick.py.core._source._symbol_param._SymbolParamColumn()
